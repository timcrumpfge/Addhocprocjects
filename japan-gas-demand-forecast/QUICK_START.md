   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ Execution Workflow

Run notebooks in the following sequence:

### 1. Data Collection and Sources (`01_data_collection_and_sources.ipynb`)
- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive data generation and processing
- Generates realistic synthetic Japanese gas demand data
- Creates calendar features, lag variables, and rolling statistics
- Exports processed dataset for use in subsequent notebooks

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (`02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`)
- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive EDA framework
- Time series patterns, seasonal decomposition, and trend analysis
- Weather correlations and sector analysis
- Statistical properties and data quality assessment

### 3. Forecasting Models (`03_forecasting_models.ipynb`)
- âœ… **COMPLETED** - Multiple forecasting approaches
- Traditional time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR)
- Advanced methods (Prophet, Ensemble models)

### 4. Model Evaluation (`04_model_evaluation.ipynb`)
- ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Comprehensive model comparison
- Time series cross-validation and performance metrics
- Residual analysis and diagnostic checking
- Statistical significance testing

### 5. Forecast Visualization (`05_forecast_visualization.ipynb`)
- ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Interactive dashboards
- Real-time forecast visualization
- Scenario analysis and sensitivity testing
- Export results and reports

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Implemented

### Data Processing (`src/data_processing.py`)
- **JapanGasDataCollector**: Synthetic data generation with realistic patterns
- **Calendar Features**: Seasonal indicators, cyclical encoding
- **Lag Features**: Historical demand patterns and rolling statistics
- **Data Validation**: Quality checks and outlier detection

### Forecasting Utilities (`src/forecasting_utils.py`)
- **Metrics Calculation**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Directional Accuracy
- **Cross-Validation**: Time series CV with walk-forward approach
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive performance assessment
- **Visualization**: Forecast plotting and comparison tools

### Synthetic Data Characteristics
- **Period**: 2018-2024 (6+ years of monthly data)
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Winter heating demand dominance
- **Weather Correlation**: Temperature and heating degree days
- **Economic Factors**: GDP growth and industrial production
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Demand reduction during pandemic period
- **Sector Breakdown**: Residential, commercial, industrial, power generation

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

### Model Performance Targets
- **MAPE < 5%** for 1-3 month ahead forecasts
- **MAPE < 8%** for 6-12 month ahead forecasts
- **Directional Accuracy > 80%** for trend prediction

### Key Insights
- Strong seasonal patterns (winter demand ~40% higher than summer)
- Temperature correlation: -0.19 (demand increases as temperature drops)
- Linear Regression performs best with MAE of 0.532
- Ensemble forecast: 3.88 Â± 0.14 million mÂ³/day

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adding Real Data
1. Replace synthetic data generation with real data loading
2. Update data sources in `JapanGasDataCollector`
3. Modify feature engineering for your specific data structure

### Model Tuning
1. Adjust hyperparameters in the model training sections
2. Add new models to the comparison framework
3. Modify cross-validation strategy as needed

### Visualization
1. Customize plots in the visualization notebooks
2. Add new dashboard components
3. Export formats for your specific needs

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Applications

- **Supply Planning**: Optimize inventory and procurement
- **Risk Management**: Identify demand volatility and trends
- **Strategic Planning**: Support infrastructure investment decisions
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce over/under-supply costs

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Memory Issues**: Reduce dataset size or use data sampling
3. **Model Convergence**: Adjust hyperparameters or try different models

### Support
- Check the README.md for detailed documentation
- Review notebook comments for implementation details
- Modify parameters based on your specific requirements

## âœ… Next Steps

1. **Run the notebooks** in sequence to see the complete analysis
2. **Customize the models** for your specific use case
3. **Integrate real data** when available
4. **Deploy models** for production forecasting
5. **Monitor performance** and update regularly
